        <h1>Lauren Mueller</h1>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>I’m a junior at the University of Massachusetts pursuing a B.A. in English with a passion for storytelling, language, and the power of the written word. My interests lie in publishing, editing, and creative writing. My goal is to combine a love for detail with creativity to help bring ideas to life.</p>
       <p>As a published poet in The Scribe, UMass’s literary magazine, I’ve developed a strong appreciation for the editing process and for crafting pieces that connect deeply with readers. I’m eager to expand my experience in the publishing world and collaborate with others who share a dedication to impactful, well-crafted writing.</p>
         <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, photography, and exploring new coffee shops around town. I believe that a good story can be found in the most unexpected places, and I’m always on the lookout for inspiration in everyday life.</p>
